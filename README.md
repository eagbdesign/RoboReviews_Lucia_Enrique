Task Description

This business case outlines the development of an NLP model to automate the processing of customer feedback for a retail company. The goal is to classify customer reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories to help the company improve its products and services. Additionally, the project involves implementing Generative AI to summarize reviews based on their score (0-5) and organize them into product categories. If the number of categories becomes too large, the focus will shift to selecting the top-K categories. The deliverables also include creating a clickable and dynamic visualization dashboard using a suitable platform.

Dataset Selected

The dataset chosen for this project is a publicly available subset of Amazon customer reviews from their online marketplace, comprising 67.959 reviews. This dataset provides a diverse range of feedback on various Amazon products. You can find the dataset at the following link: Amazon Reviews Dataset.

We combined three separate datasets into one, which we named df_combined to streamline the analysis and modeling process.
